"""Unit test 30: the OpenMP race check with EuclidEmulator2 on.

Cocoa pins a modified EuclidEmulator2 (the EE2_GIT_COMMIT of
set_installation_options.sh): OpenMP threading, a 1,010-redshift
capacity, the get_boost2 API with a pre-built emulator, memory-leak
fixes, and a bilinear interpolation with a border fix (the
repository's README, external_modules/code/euclidemu2/README.md,
documents them).

The standard race checks (the test_example*.py files) run with the
nonlinear P(k) from CAMB's Takahashi halofit (non_linear_emul: 2, the
setting of the frozen configurations), so EE2's compute never executes
inside them, and a race in it would go unseen. A race is a bug where
OpenMP threads write shared memory in an order that changes from run to
run. This test repeats
the race check on the DES-Y3 cosmic-shear configuration with the
nonlinear P(k) from EE2 (non_linear_emul: 1): the fiducial
evaluated fresh and again as the 10th of 10 cosmologies on one
model instance. EE2's compute is OpenMP-threaded, so leaked state
or a thread race inside it shifts the second fiducial value; the
two must agree within RACE_TOLERANCE (1e-4).

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/des_y3/tests/data_vector/test_ee2.py
