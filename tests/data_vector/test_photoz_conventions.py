"""Unit test: the runtime n(z) photo-z conventions.

The likelihood exposes two runtime settings that control how the n(z)
table files are turned into the smooth distributions the Limber
integrals consume (both settable per likelihood in its yaml, both
defaulting to 0, the setting the shipped n(z) tables and the frozen
references use):

  photoz_interpolation_type - the stage-1 interpolant of the two-stage
      n(z) scheme: 0 = cubic spline (the default), 1 = linear,
      2+ = Steffen monotone (no overshoot: n(z) can never ring below
      zero around a sharp feature in the table).
  photoz_zmid_convention - how the z column of the n(z) file is read:
      0 = Z_LOW (the default; the column holds left bin edges, so the
      tabulated value belongs at the cell center z + dz/2), 1 = Z_MID
      (the column holds the sample points themselves). The two
      readings differ by a rigid dz/2 shift of every distribution,
      which is percent-level in cosmic shear.

This test evaluates the frozen cosmic-shear fiducial under five
settings in one process: the default, each alternative, and the
default again. For each alternative it measures

    delta chi2 = delta^T C^-1 delta,
    delta = dv(alternative) - dv(default),

with C^-1 the masked inverse covariance from the compiled interface:
the same second-order construction the CFASTPT-vs-FASTPT sweep uses
(the chi2 the alternative would score against a dataset whose data
vector is the default prediction). A chi2 difference against the
shipped data would instead follow the first-order slope of the chi2,
since the fiducial is far from the best fit of the real data.

Running everything in one process is the point, not a convenience:
the n(z) table caches inside the compiled interface must notice a
runtime flag change and rebuild. A stale cache would make every
delta exactly zero (the alternatives assert delta chi2 > 0), and the
final return to the default must reproduce the first vector (the
round-trip assertion), so a cache that over- or under-invalidates
fails loudly here.

To run (from the Cocoa/ folder, cocoa environment active,
start_cocoa.sh sourced):

    python -m pytest ./projects/des_y3/tests/data_vector/test_photoz_conventions.py
